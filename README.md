## Project setup
Sorry it is a little cumbersome.
Install \src\components\MindMap.vue to your components folder.
Then you need to install public\static\leader-line.js file.
And <script src="static/leader-line.js"></script> write this in your html file.

### why is this process necessary
Because I couldn't import LeaderLine with npm.
